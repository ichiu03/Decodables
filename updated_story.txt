In the vivid town of Carville,Zoomer zipped past,his glint in the day."I am ready for the next race!"he said.Rusty,a pickup truck,laughed."Zoomer,it is not just about speed.Teamwork and ease will help you advance."Zoomer was ready to win.Little did he know,the real race was just beginning.Zoomer and Rusty met at the space,a spot with fun items and tasks.Let us aim at communication!Rusty led Zoomer with a set of drills.They practiced gas drills together,racing back and away.As the dark fell,Zoomer began to see Rustyâ€™s patience.You are not just a truck.You are a teammate.Rusty was glad to give his tips.On race day,excitement buzzed through Carville as drivers lined up.Zoomer sped ahead,his centrifugal loud.But as he sped past a curve,he spotted another unit stuck in the mud.He paused and skidded to a stop.Together,they freed the vehicle.In that moment,Zoomer found that assisting others was better than getting there beginning.
