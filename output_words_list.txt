Barkley
the
nice
retriever
enjoyed
exploring
his
yard
One
bright
midday
while
running
with
his
favorite
ball
he
peered
into
a
hole
Curiosity
twinkled
as
he
imagined
what
lay
beyond
Excited
he
rushed
to
get
his
pals
Bella
the
beagle
Max
the
bulldog
and
Luna
the
poodle
With
eyes
wide
they
went
inside
the
tiny
tunnel
togetherBarkley
and
his
friends
squeezed
through
the
hole
and
tumbled
into
a
vibrant
park
buzzing
with
life
Colorful
wings
danced
in
the
wind
while
bright
jewels
glistened
Barkley
ran
with
joy
along
with
Bella
Max
and
Luna
They
laughed
and
made
new
friends
But
as
the
sun
began
to
dip
they
realized
they
had
wandered
too
far
from
homeDetermined
Barkley
sniffed
the
scent
of
familiar
items
With
Bellas
keen
sight
Maxs
strength
and
Lunas
skill
they
retraced
their
paw
prints
through
the
park
The
stars
began
to
twinkle
and
they
spotted
the
hole
With
a
leap
they
squeezed
back
into
their
backyard
realizing
their
greatest
treasure
was
the
warmth
of
home
and
friendship
