In
town
Max
a
golden
retriever
bounded
through
the
streets
tail
wagging
He
stumbled
upon
an
empty
space
Swings
creaked
We
could
play
here
barked
Max
His
ears
perked
up
Imagine
the
fun
we
d
have
But
the
other
pets
were
too
tied
up
Max
gathered
their
friends
to
announce
Dog
D
at
the
playground
This
is
our
time
to
tell
everyone
how
fun
it
is
he
said
But
the
sky
glimmered
bright
and
only
a
few
pets
came
Some
slept
while
others
went
elsewhere
Max
undeterred
told
tales
of
blissful
fun
in
the
past
Let
s
bring
back
the
fun
he
barked
Slowly
wags
began
to
twist
With
new
energy
the
pups
dove
into
the
upkeep
Max
led
teams
some
picked
up
bits
while
others
pulled
up
pieces
Laughter
echoed
through
the
team
as
they
raced
to
see
who
could
stack
the
most
The
scene
shifted
Piles
of
noise
picked
up
with
the
pups
puffing
joyfully
