In the heart of the verdant forest, there rested a glimmering creek where a team of energetic frogs bounded and danced merrily. Every day, the creek echoed with their cheerful croaks and fun-loving games, as they sprang from one flower mat to another, daring each other to swim faster or dive further. One sunny morning, a new frog arrived with a huge grin and even huge claims. "I am the greatest leaper in all the ground," he asserted bravely, exhaling out his chest. The other frogs exchanged hesitant word1, then dared him to a leaping contest to prove his abilities. With a confident leap, the newcomer soared into the sky, only to plummet short of the farthest flower mat. As he labored to enhance, the other frogs understood his need for guidance. They taught him the benefit of exercise, endurance, and most essentially, modesty. Through teamwork and camaraderie, the frogs and the newcomer learned that true success does not come from exceeding one another but from encouraging and encouraging each other. As the sun set over the foliage, they congregated together, new friends connected by shared skills and smiles.
