The first week of August feels like the peak of summer, a calm and hot time before autumn's chill sets in. The world is strangely quiet, with blank sunrises, shining moons, and colorful sunsets full of bright colors. At night, a single spark glows in the sky, without thunder or rain. In the hot summer days, it's important to think before acting to avoid feeling sorry later.
