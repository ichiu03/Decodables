The first week of August is like the very top of a Ferris wheel, where it takes a little break before going down. In the weeks leading up to autumn, the weather goes from mild spring to cool autumn. Although it is the first week of August, it is still very hot and eerily quiet. Each day begins with creamy mornings, ends with bright sunsets, and is marked by strong moons. Sometimes at night, a spark shines in the sky without any thunder or rain. These are the dog days, when people act impulsively and regret their behavior later.
