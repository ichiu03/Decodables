In
a
tiny
nook
Whiskers
a
tabby
was
hinting
at
new
things
On
a
misty
midday
he
stumbled
into
a
dusty
attic
The
tale
hinted
at
a
Feline
Treasure
Thrilled
he
dashed
to
announce
the
tale
to
his
mates
Mittens
the
tabby
and
Luna
the
cat
They
set
off
on
an
amazing
journeyAs
they
journeyed
beyond
the
familiar
paths
Whiskers
led
his
friends
to
the
tall
gate
that
divided
their
area
Time
for
a
climb
he
declared
Mittens
nimbly
scaled
while
Luna
provided
wise
advice
scouting
the
safest
route
They
cheered
each
other
on
They
climbed
ahead
making
a
fine
path
that
unity
can
achieve
The
adventure
beganAs
they
reached
the
top
the
shimmering
water
sparkled
below
While
we
jump
he
said
Mittens
leapt
gracefully
while
Luna
had
a
great
idea
Lets
use
these
twigs
Together
they
moved
in
harmony
With
teamwork
and
laughter
each
step
brought
them
a
bit
nearer
to
their
treasure
