in
the
place
of
brewtopia
the
air
had
the
aroma
of
fresh
coffee
children
sipped
their
hot
chocolate
while
adults
gathered
chatting
about
the
annual
coffee
bean
festival
among
the
folks
was
a
10-year-old
girl
her
dark
brown
orbs
bright
with
joy
and
her
tresses
tied
in
a
tidy
coif
she
gained
fame
for
her
bold
spirit
and
unyielding
queries
all
the
coffee
had
vanished
the
normally
bustling
streets
echoed
mrs
butter
asked
how
she
will
cope
without
coffee
butter
the
town
chef
lamented
the
lost
items
for
her
famous
coffee
treats
mr
java
the
barista
was
so
mad
that
his
coffee
cups
made
them
feel
sad
a
boost
of
determination
came
to
her
i
cannot
let
brewtopia
down
i
will
find
those
she
said
her
tone
resolute
her
best
friend
max
could
solve
just
about
any
puzzle
and
hopped
beside
her
i
am
in
let
us
inspect
he
exclaimed
they
set
off
gathering
clues
from
the
locals
mrs
buttercup
hinted
i
saw
something
moving
near
the
fields
mr
java
saw
tracks
leading
into
the
field
and
the
farmer
mr
beanstalk
heard
a
faint
giggle
coming
from
the
enchanted
forest
just
before
dawn
with
a
list
crammed
full
of
tips
and
her
pulse
racing
from
excitement
she
turned
to
max
lucy
told
me
to
step
into
the
enchanted
forest
and
to
take
those
beans
before
the
festival
max
nodded
his
expression
full
of
thrill
together
they
began
their
quest
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
coffee
as
max
and
a
pet
went
into
the
enchanted
forest
the
plants
stood
their
bodies
rustling
with
secrets
sunlight
moved
through
the
trees
casting
soft
forms
on
the
ground
the
air
was
cool
with
a
scent
but
a
twinge
of
unease
deep
inside
do
you
truly
need
other
things
here
she
said
her
pulse
racing
with
both
joy
and
fear
of
course
we
just
must
find
the
clues
max
said
adjusting
his
frame
with
a
plan
mrs
buttercup
told
her
about
something
moving
here
as
they
took
their
path
deeper
the
sounds
of
chirping
surrounded
them
but
soon
they
found
a
rickety
item
it
creaked
ominously
beneath
their
feet
please
go
now
they
steadied
and
moved
swiftly
clutching
tight
they
stood
on
the
other
side
making
a
sound
of
relief
suddenly
a
flurry
of
giggles
erupted
from
behind
a
bush
out
popped
a
group
of
tiny
squirrels
their
cute
bodies
twitching
mischievously
one
of
the
creatures
inquired
balancing
a
little
item
on
its
face
we
are
searching
for
the
coffee
missing

another
creature
squeaked
you
must
solve
our
riddles
to
go
through
the
rodents
began
m
max
shouted
making
a
chorus
of
delighted
squeaks
from
the
rodents
you
are
they
chirped
but
there
is
more
they
respected
the
journey
of
coffee—from
bean
to
max
sat
in
silence
as
one
of
the
critters
the
leader
with
a
bushy
form
named
nutty
shared
the
riddles
to
brew
a
drink
i
find
only
a
few
but
what
flips
color
from
pink
or
orange
hmm
if

fruit

squeaked
clapping
his
paws
together
now
for
the
next
one

am
steep
i
am
comfort
and
cheer
but
i

she
exclaimed
a
brilliant
smile
on
her
face
again
the
animals
cheered
dancing
in
pairs
to
go
on
one
last
puzzle
must
be
told
with
a
friend
and
stories
within
you
find
about
a
trip
up
close
one
that
begins
at
day’s
ray
max
a
little
lost
sat
could
it
be
a
tale
that
holds
stories
of
lands
unspied
our
journey
to
the
coffee
you
solved
each
riddle
now
your
song
is
true

get
to
the
grove
where
bean
guardians
will
be
for
you
with
newfound
confidence
max
thanked
the
cute
and
speedy
ones
and
went
deeper
into
the
land
the
critters
looked
pleased
their
eyes
twinkling
as
they
approached
a
bright
glade
the
air
felt
lively
there
surrounded
by
ancient
giants
were
the
bean
guardians
—
beings
of
shimmering
strands
each
one
adorned
with
mesmerizing
patterns
hello
seekers
of
the
coffee
their
tones
chimed
resonating
with
heat

what
you
have
and
the
coffee
shall
be
for
you

is
her
chance

would
never
need
their
coffee
again
