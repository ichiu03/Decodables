Chief woke up excited and a little nervous for his big test day at the institute. During the advent, the teacher surprised the group with a reproduction chart test. Despite feeling concerned and worried, Chief tried his best during the test, taking his time to review his work in the difficult sections. When the test ended, Chief felt proud of his efforts and trusted he had succeeded. The teacher said grades will be given tomorrow. Chief happily came back home, knowing he had worked hard and remained persistent for success.
