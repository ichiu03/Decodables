The first week of August is like the top of the summer, high up like a Ferris wheel seat pausing at the top. It's a calm and hot time, before the chill of autumn. Before and after weeks bring different weather, but the first week of August is calm and hot at the peak of summer. It is strangely quiet, with blank sunrises, bright noons, and colorful sunsets smeared with too much color. At night, a spark quivers alone. There is no thunder or rain to cool things down. These are strange days, the dog days, when people do things they may regret later.
