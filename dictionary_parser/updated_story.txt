Chapter 1: Tom and the Lost Pup One sunny day, Tom ran in the park with Max, his playful dog. Tom loved the park's green fields and tall trees. As they played, Tom noticed a tiny, scared puppy. "Hello, little one. Are you lost?" Tom asked with a gentle tone. The pup, named Sparky, whimpered softly. Concerned, Tom decided to help Sparky find his family. Guiding Sparky through the park, they faced challenges, like crossing a busy street. But with persistence and kindness, Tom persevered. Together, they embarked on an expedition to reunite Sparky with his loved ones.
