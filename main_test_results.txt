  **A Day at the Park**

Tom woke up, feeling bright and ready for the weekend. The sun was shining, and the sky was blue. He quickly grabbed his shoes, eager to go out. Today, he would meet his friends at Maplewood Park.

Arriving at the park, he spotted his friends, Sarah and Jake, by the entrance. “Hey, guys!” he exclaimed, waving with joy. They waved back, all smiling. “Let’s find a sunny spot!” Tom's heart raced with excitement. Together, they grabbed a picnic blanket and walked toward a large oak tree, which had wide, green leaves.

Upon finding the right spot, they set their blanket down and opened their bags. “Let’s play frisbee!” Sarah said. The trio took turns tossing the disk, laughing each time it spun. They raced to grab it, each thinking they would win. After a few rounds, they felt pumped, so they ran to the swings.

“Look! Who can swing the highest?” shouted Jake, jumping on a swing. They took turns flying as high as the sky, feeling light and full of laughter. After swinging, they wandered to the pond, spotting ducks gliding on the water. “Let’s feed them!” Tom said, pulling out leftover bread. 

As they tossed pieces to the ducks, one duck wiggled up and grabbed a bite right from Tom's hand! Everyone laughed, and this silly moment made their day even brighter. Tom felt happy, knowing these moments would stay in his heart forever.
Tom and his friends sat on their blanket, enjoying snacks as they chatted. Laughter filled the air as they shared funny stories. “Remember when we tried to bake cookies?” Sarah said, giggling. “We filled the whole floor with dough!” The other kids laughed, remembering the mess they made. 

“I think it was good, even if it didn't look right,” Jake added, his cheeks rosy with joy. “The floor had a bit of sugar, though!” They all laughed again.

After their snacks, they felt ready for more fun. “Let’s go on a walk!” Sarah suggested. They jumped up, excited by the thought of exploring. 

The path at Maplewood Park was lined with trees. Sunlight peeked through the leaves, making the ground look bright and soft. As they walked, they spotted small birds flitting from tree to tree, chirping happily. “Look at those tiny spots!” Tom pointed out. 

The group followed a narrow trail, admiring the beauty all around. Each step took them deeper into the park. They found a pond filled with colorful fish. “Wow, look!” Jake exclaimed. “These fish are beautiful!” 

Tom took a big breath of fresh air. “Nature is awesome!” he said. 

They sat by the water, soaking in the moment. “Days like this make me feel so good,” Tom added, feeling grateful for both nature and his friends. After a bit, they decided it was time to head back, ready to play more before the sun went down.
