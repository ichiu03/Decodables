### A Day at the Park Tom woke up on Saturday feeling very excited. The sun was shining, and he knew it was going to be a fun day. He could hardly wait to visit Sunnyvale Park with his friends. The park was large, with a playground, a pond, and many trees—a lively spot filled with laughter. When Tom arrived at the park, he saw his friends Sarah and Jake waiting at the entrance. "HEY! Ready for some fun?" Tom shouted, running up to them. "What should we do first?" Sarah asked. "Let’s head to the playground!" Jake suggested. They all laughed and raced into the park together. At the playground, Tom dashed to the swings. He hopped on and swung high into the BLUE sky, feeling like a superhero. "Look at me!" he shouted, throwing his hands up in the air. After playing on the swings, they tackled the CLIMBING structure, WORKING as a team to help each other up the tall WALL. Just then, a friendly dog appeared. It wagged its tail and ran in circles, full of energy. Tom grinned and picked up a stick. The dog took off after it with joy. "He’s fast!" Sarah exclaimed, LAUGHING. They played fetch until they were tired, their hearts filled with happiness. With smiles on their faces, they decided it was time for a picnic under the big oak tree. Spreading out a blanket, Tom and his friends settled beneath the shady branches. Sunlight peeked through the leaves, creating little patches of light on their food. "I BROUGHT COOKIES!" Sarah said, pulling out a container. Jake opened his bag to reveal sandwiches. "And I BROUGHT FRUIT!" Tom added excitedly, taking out bright apples and JUICY oranges. As they sat down to eat, they shared STORIES about their week. "I TRIED to build a birdhouse," Tom said, "but it fell down!" They all laughed. "You need more practice!" Jake teased, nudging him. "I want to try again, though!" Tom REPLIED with a smile. After munching on their treats, Sarah looked around and said, "What has been your favorite part of today?" Tom thought for a moment. "The swings felt like flying! How about you?" he asked. "Playing fetch with that dog was the best!" Jake chimed in, his eyes sparkling with joy. The friends then leaned back to rest under the oak tree. Tom looked up at the sky, feeling thankful for the day. The laughter, the food, and all the fun were treasures he WANTED to keep. Once the picnic ended, they cleaned up and packed their bags. "What’s next on our list?" Tom asked, filled with energy once more. "Let’s explore the nature trail!" Sarah said, her eyes wide with excitement. They all nodded, ready for their next adventure as they headed toward the path, eager to discover what nature would reveal.
