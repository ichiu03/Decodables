**Caleb's First Day of Football PRACTICE** Caleb roused up with a beaming SMILE. Today was the day he had been keenly awaiting. At just ten years old, he had an unparalleled passion for football. He had watched all the big games with his mom and dad, cheering, laughing, and enjoying each chance. But now, it was finally his turn to PLAY. The sun beamed BRIGHTLY, and the sky was CLEAR. Caleb excitedly pulled out his new, BRIGHT WHITE top and shiny new cap. He laced up his new shoes, ready to move. Although his gut twitched with fear, he pushed the feelings away. This was his chance. He dashed to the park. When Caleb arrived at the park, he could hear the joyful sounds of boys PLAYING. They were running, yelling, and laughing. The field was vast, and the other kids seemed TALLER and OLDER than him. Although he seemed a bit SMALL, he held his head high. He reminded himself that he was not ALONE. Suddenly, he met Max. Max had a big SMILE and a warm demeanor. “Hey, Caleb! You look like you’re GOING to be a hero out there!” Max exclaimed. Caleb FELT a rush of confidence. They chatted about their top teammates and shared jokes to calm their fears. Just then, the mentor—a kind woman named Mentor Lee—clapped her hands to get everyone’s ATTENTION. “Alright, team! Let’s get STARTED!” Caleb’s heart raced, but he held his head high. Mentor Lee was both firm and ENCOURAGING as she explained the tasks, and he began to feel MORE at EASE. With each TASK, Caleb GAVE it his all. At first, EVERYTHING seemed tough, but then he began to get the HANG of it. He fell once or TWICE, but Mentor Lee cheered him on. “You’re doing GREAT! Everyone makes mistakes!” With a resounding cheer from his teammates, Caleb dashed for a GOAL. Joy filled him. Today marked the beginning of an EXCITING new journey, and he couldn’t wait for MORE fun ahead!
