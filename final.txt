The vast field waved before him, and his pals were already there, calling and happy to see him. The whistle banged, and his heart hurried. Caleb darted toward the ball.

He couldn't BELIEVE he was in a real GAME with everyone! After the match, Caleb keenly hoped for the next one. He seemed full of joy. He ran joyfully, chasing the ball and making fast, neat taps. The team worked hard TOGETHER. "Pass!" Fay yelled, and Caleb threw the ball the right way to her. They moved TOGETHER across the field, the team cheering, and it seemed thrilling. One MOMENT had Caleb laughing. A boy on the team attempted to bash the ball but missed! He tumbled and fell, making the kids giggle. Caleb helped him up, and they both beamed, ready to give it each go. The GAME continued, and although TIME seemed to dart, EVERY MOMENT seemed MAGICAL. At the end, Caleb and Fay high-fived. "That was so much fun!" she exclaimed, her eyes shining. Caleb nodded EAGERLY. "I can’t wait to PLAY again!"
